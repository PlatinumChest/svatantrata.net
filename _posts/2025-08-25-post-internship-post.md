title: "How my IT Operations Internship Went"
---

July 25th, was the graduation day of my IT Internship where I had to present a capstone presentation on how the internship went here are some highlights of what I learned:
&nbsp;
- Mass Imaging: Using Avanti I was able to provision all of the new loaner laptops for the school including some staff devices with the appropriate software in place and ensuring devices were in their correct OU.
- Firewall Overview: With the Network Engineer we looked at the current state of the firewall and the processes required to shift the rules while maintaining security as well as how the VPN connections function.
- VLANs: We saw the network diagram for campus along with what each VLAN was tied to and their purposes.
- Cabling: I terminated and tested various cables including some ports to identify port configurations and status using Fluke Network devices.
- Documentation: I had to document all the ports in a room to see if they are in the right configuration as well as if any of them did not receive signal or were broken, I also had to keep track of all the devices we were provisioning and ensure everything was correct.
