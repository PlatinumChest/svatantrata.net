title: "Initial HomeLab Purchases"
---

With the money I earned from my Internship I will be buying a list of items for my homelab. 
I currently have a C6100 server and 2 Proliant DL360p Gen8 servers that each have 256GB of RAM from a BTC auction. 
I also have a Juniper Switch and I am using the default Spectrum Router and Modem. 
In addition I have a Raspberry Pi 5 with cooling and a ultra fast sd card for monitoring my cluster and power. 
Finally I have a small UPS which will be enough for my switch, router, and Raspberry Pi. 
With this setup I have enough for basic connectivity but I want a more robust network and better security so this is what I plan to buy:

- EdgeRouter-4 (For VLANs, basic firewall and other features for my network)
- Cat 6A Cables (I do not have enough cables to fully connect everything in my homelab so Cat 6a cables will do very well)
- Ubiquiti Access Point (I need a new AP with a new router and this is a good cost effective solution to my problem)
- 12 2TB Barracuda HDDs (I would like to fully fill up my C6100 with drives for 24TB of raw storage!)
- C6100 Caddies (The C6100 only came with 3 Caddies so I need to buy 9 more)
- Velcro Zipties (A good resource to organize to my cables)
- Cable Tags (For organization)
- Small USB-drives (Good quality USB drives for my C6100 nodes to boot from)
- 2200VA UPS (To protect 5 of 6 nodes from potential damage)
- Hard Drive screws
