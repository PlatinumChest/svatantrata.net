title: "Changing Plans"

With the holiday season in full swing, I’ve decided to spend the next few weeks focusing on family and secondary hobbies. As a result, I am adjusting the **Vardhana Labs** roadmap: the milestones for Weeks 2 and 3 (Workloads and Active Directory) are being pushed back.

Instead, my primary focus will shift to the objectives originally planned for Weeks 4 and 5. This includes:
* **NUT (Network UPS Tools)** configurations
* **Disaster Recovery (DR)** planning
* **High Availability (HA)** setups
* **Comprehensive Backup** strategies

I’ve made this decision because my academic schedule will lighten up significantly once winter break ends and we head into February. Shifting these priorities now allows me to focus on infrastructure stability over the holidays, while saving the more intensive "fun" projects for when I can dedicate my full attention to them without school distractions.
