title: "The Start of my 3rd Semester BTC and Senior HS Year"
---

Today was the start of my 3rd Semester BTC program. I am currently taking the Technical Support Specialist Associate of Applied Science program. This semester along with Pre-Calculus at my Highschool I will be taking 21 college credits total to catch back up in speed and to ensure I graduate with my full associates. 
There are a few interesting courses I am taking like:

- Enterprise Fundamentals: Storage (This includes different solutions like DAS, NAS, SAN, Cloud, and Hybrid Models)
- Enterprise Fundamentals: Scripting & Automation
- Virtualization: Hyper-V and VMware
