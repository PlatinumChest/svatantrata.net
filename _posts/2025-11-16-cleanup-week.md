title: "Cleanup Week"
---

This week I decided it would be the perfect time to do some cleanup in my room. 
It was a pretty busy week but I wanted to ensure that all the cabling and all of my materials are nice and orderly. 
I ensured during the cleanup of my room to not disrupt services by marking each power cable and what they are connected to and if any necessary disruptions had to happen I would warn my family beforehand and do it when they weren't using the wifi.

With the new cleaned up room and whiteboards I will be putting up photos soon on my website to show what my cluster really looks like. 
Next week I hope to finish cleaning up my room and making network diagrams as well as putting work into my school work.
