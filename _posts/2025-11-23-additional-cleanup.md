title: "Additional Cleanup"
---

This week was also more of a cleaning up and making sure that all of my configurations and servers are all cleaned up since I have reached a good stable base system. 
Along with that these following 3 weeks will be slightly bland in terms of work as I am reaching my final college weeks, holidays and having fun days. 
This week I have specifically cleaned these items:

- BMC: Ensuring the configuration is set and functioning for remote administration.
- Wireguard: Fixing broken configurations and verifying functionality.
- Pterodactyl: Removing any unused eggs and also creating isolation for different games.
- Network: Added new VLANs, changed names and removed old testing configurations.

Next week is a busy one so I will only be starting to add some services but soon enough I will be free to do what I want.
